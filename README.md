# iCat

## Brief introduction

* iCat is an online shopping website for cats food, toys and so on. 
* iCat supports all the basic functions like login, register, order track, search products, sort products by price, administrator management, etc. 

## Technologies I have used

* use __MVC__ to design the whole architecture of the shopping website
* use __Java__ to write the website’s backend
* use __JSP, Html, CSS, JavaScript__ to write the front-end
* select __MySQL__ as the database
* and __Apache Tomcat__ as the website’s server
* and deploy it on __Azure__
  
## Something Sweet

* I adopted an adorable kitty while developing this website, the little sweetheart loves sleeping on my arms while I am tapping codes. Now you know why my project is named 'iCat'.
