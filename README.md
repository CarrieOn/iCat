# iCat

## Brief introduction

* iCat is an online shopping website for cats food, toys and so on. 
* iCat supports all the basic functions like login, register, order track, search products, sort products by price, administrator management, etc. 

## Technologies I have used

* use __MVC__ to design the whole architecture of the shopping website
* use __Java__ to write the website’s backend
* use __JSP, Html, CSS, JavaScript__ to write the front-end
* select __MySQL__ as the database
* and __Apache Tomcat__ as the website’s server
* and finally deploy it on __Azure__

## Last but sweetest

* I adopted a cute kitty while developing this website, he loves sleeping on my arm when I am tapping codes, so I name it 'iCat' to show my love for my sweetheart.
